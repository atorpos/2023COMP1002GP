That really depends on how you feel about not being able to play some of the more text-heavy titles, and your opinion on some of the Japanese-exclusive games. The Famicom Classic Mini is perhaps best seen as a companion piece to the NES Classic Mini in this respect; there are just enough differences between the two – both cosmetic and in terms of software – to ensure that both are worthy of place under your television. It's just a shame that the controllers are so small and that the cables are so short; without a means of solving these issues via third-parties accessories, the Famicom Classic Mini is more of an acquired taste – but one that a great many Nintendo fans will want to sample nonetheless.<br></span></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-2" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title"><span class="blog-permalink">More</span></h1><div class="blog-entry-date">12/08/23 19:02 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;">Like the NES Classic Mini, this system suffers from very short cable length which forces you to sit right in front of the television. You could argue that in the case of the Famicom, this was the norm – look for any image of Japanese kids playing on the console in the '80s and you'll see them right in front of the TV – but for 30-something players today, the prospect of sitting cross-legged on the floor might be less appealing. Unlike the NES Classic Mini – which has both&nbsp;</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#0000E9;"><u><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/8bitdo_is_bringing_a_wireless_controller_option_to_the_nes_classic_mini">wireless</a></u></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#0000E9;"><u><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/there_are_more_nes_classic_mini_accessories_on_the_way">wired</a></u></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;">&nbsp;solutions to this problem – there's no way of overcoming this issue with the Famicom Classic Mini.<br>The design of the Famicom is replicated so closely that the system features hardwired controllers, just like the original, and these slot onto the sides of the machine when not in use. Because the Famicom Classic Mini is smaller, the pads have naturally been shrunk as well to ensure that they still fit. This is perhaps the biggest bugbear with this system; while the pads are still perfectly usable, those of you with large hands might find them uncomfortable over long periods of time.<br></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;"><br></span></div></div><div id="unique-entry-id-1" class="blog-entry"><h1 class="blog-entry-title"><span class="blog-permalink">Hardware: Famicom Classic Mini Review</span></h1><div class="blog-entry-date">12/08/23 19:01 </div><div class="blog-entry-body"><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;">With the&nbsp;</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#0000E9;"><u><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/11/hardware_review_nes_classic_mini_nintendo_entertainment_system">NES Classic Mini</a></u></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;">&nbsp;currently proving to be quite hard to find at retail right now, chances are that the thought of sourcing its Japanese sibling may have crossed your mind. Released at the same time and boasting a design which imitates that of the system that started it all – 1983's "Family Computer", or Famicom – this Japanese variant appears to be slightly easier to obtain, despite the fact that you'll have to order one from abroad. However, should you choose to take the plunge –&nbsp;</span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#0000E9;"><u><a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/gamedigga?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1">GameDigga</a></u></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;">&nbsp;kindly supplied our unit – you'll find a console which is well worth the effort, despite the obvious similarities it shares with the western version.<br>The biggest difference between the Famicom Classic Mini and the NES Classic Mini is obviously the design. As we all know, Nintendo's 8-bit hardware was redesigned by Lance Barr when it was released in North America, and the cute red-and-white casing was usurped in favour of a VCR-style aesthetic which attempted to distance the NES from consoles like the Atari 2600, which had turned retailers against the industry following the crash of '83. The Famicom Classic Mini looks like a toy, and that's part of its charm; while the NES has an iconic style, it's angular and even somewhat dull in comparison.<br></span><span style="font:12px Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#262626;"><br><br></span></div></div>
